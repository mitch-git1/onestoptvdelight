Kaoru Kamiya, the acting master of the &ldquo;Kamiya Kasshin-ryu&rdquo; style, was chasing after the &ldquo;Hitokiri Battosai,&rdquo; who was claiming to be a user of her sword style. One night, Kaoru meets a man carrying a sword. She immediately questions the man, but he seems to have absolutely no will to fight. &ldquo;Is this the rumored Hitokiri Battosai?&rdquo; As Kaoru dubiously looks on, the man introduces himself as Kenshin Himura, a &ldquo;Rurouni.&rdquo;

Although the name of Kamiya Dojo has been cleared, there's no sign of an increase in the number of Kaoru's students. Then a passing boy, Yahiko Myojin, pickpockets Kenshin's wallet. Kenshin gives him the wallet, saying that it was his fault for allowing it to get stolen. Yahiko is repulsed at being treated like a child, but he has a reason to collect the money.

Kenshin comes to his rescue and settles the matter. Regretful that he could not solve the problem by himself, Yahiko wishes to become stronger. Seeing this, Kenshin takes Yahiko to the Kamiya Dojo.

Sanosuke Sagara, who happened to be in the store during the quarrel, stood up and blew away the activists with a single flick to the forehead.

This leads Kenshin to instead launch a barrage of blows at him, and Sanosuke falls to the ground. For a moment it looked as if victory has been decided. However, while Sanosuke is in a daze, he recalls the reason for his obsession with victory, his past from ten years ago when he was in the Sekiho Army...

His true identity was Jine Udo, a vagabond slayer who had made a name for himself in the assassination business since the Bakumatsu Era.

With only two minutes until Kaoru dies of asphyxiation - Kenshin's anger reaches its peak.

However, Kenshin and Sanosuke are perplexed at how he even got his hands on the drug, since opium is banned and too expensive for the average person to afford. Then a mysterious woman, Megumi Takani, appears before them. Kenshin and the others fight off Kanryu Takeda's private army who is trying to capture Megumi. However, Megumi is carrying opium...

Sanosuke, however, was still unsettled and feeling frustrated knowing that Megumi was the one who made the opium that caused his friend's death. Then one day, Megumi suddenly disappears. In a letter they found from her, it stated that she had left of her own volition, but Kenshin and the others found this to be unnatural. They decide to head to Kanryu Takeda's residence, the man who was sending spies after her.

He trifles Kenshin with his martial arts skills and his &quot;Arm-extension Spell&quot;, but Kenshin successfully conquers him when he uncovers the secret of the technique during the fight. Just when it looked like the battle was up, Han'nya removes his mask and reveals his startling true face.

In the Bakumatsu Era, the battle-obsessed &quot;Oniwaban group&quot; lost their meaning of existence after surrendering the castle they served without even being able to fight. Aoshi is unable to bear this regret and is in earnest pursuit of the title of the strongest warrior. As a former Revolutionary warrior, Kenshin cannot tolerate conflict without morality. Two men who made killing their profession in the Bakumatsu Era clash against one another, putting their pride on the line.

Kenshin and the Oniwaban group team up to challenge the overwhelming power of a modern weapon.

Curious about what he's doing, Kenshin, Kaoru, and Sanosuke decide to follow him. What exactly is Yahiko's reason for ditching?

He claims he has come to challenge Yahiko, with whom he doesn't get along, to a match, but the way Yutaro holds his bamboo sword is no good...

He takes Yutaro's hand and leads him out of the medical room, so they could witness the final battle between Kenshin and Raijuta.

Deep in the night on a woodland path, Kenshin and Raijuta's duel begins.

It was a painting of the man he looked up to as his master back when he was a member of the Sekiho Army, Captain Sagara. With a gleam in his eyes, Sanosuke makes his way to meet with the artist of the painting.
